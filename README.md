## 👋 Hi, I’m Gilmar Correia

I’m a developer and researcher passionate about the intersection of **AI, Cloud, and Robotics** — transforming ideas into scalable, intelligent systems.  

My work blends **cloud infrastructure (GCP, Terraform, Cloud Run, Kubernetes)** with **robotics simulation and control (ROS 2, CoppeliaSim, C++)**, aiming to design technologies that empower people and industries.

Currently, I’m leading projects focused on **educational innovation and Industry 5.0**, such as the **DropS initiative**, which bridges advanced technology with human skill development.
